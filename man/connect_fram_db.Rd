\title{Connect to FRAM database}
\usage{
connect_fram_db(db_path, read_only = FALSE, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{db_path}{Path to a FRAM database.}

\item{read_only}{Logical, defaults to FALSE. Optional argument to flag this connection as read-only (if set to \code{TRUE}). If \code{TRUE}, framrsquared functions that modify
the database will abort rather than run. Use as a safety feature when working with a database that \emph{must not} be modified.}

\item{quiet}{Logical, defaults to FALSE. Optional argument; when TRUE, silences success message and database summary.}
}
\description{
This produces a connection object to a FRAM database, which is a necessary precursor
for almost all framrsquared functions. For most users, can just treat the connection
object as a black box that's used as an argument in other functions. See details for an explanation of the returned object.
}
\details{
The returned object of \code{connect_fram_db()} is a list of useful objects for other framrsquared functions.
\describe{
\item{\verb{$fram_db_connection}}{connection object, used for SQL calls.}
\item{\verb{$fram_db_connection_id}}{connection name in .fram_connections, used for orphan cleanup via \code{disconnect_all_fram_connections()}.}
\item{\verb{$fram_db_type}}{"full" or "transfer", useful for validation for specific functions.}
\item{\verb{$fram_db_species}}{"COHO" or "CHINOOK"}
\item{\verb{$fram_db_species}}{filetype, typeically "mdb"}
\item{\verb{$fram_read_only}}{Optional user-specified safety measure, TRUE or FALSE. Functions that modify the fram database should error out if TRUE.}
}

framrsquared creates a special environment in the global environment, \code{.fram_connections}. Whenever a new connection is made with \code{connect_fram_db}, it is added to that environment as well; whenever the connection is closed with \code{disconnect_fram_db()}, the connection is removed from that environment. This tracking allows \code{disconnect_all_fram_connections()} to clear out any orphan connections made by assigning a connection to an existing connection object.

\dontrun{fram_db <- connect_fram_db('<path>')
