\title{Helper function to check that stock id make sense}
\usage{
stock_check_helper(table_name, NumStk, stock_vec, uniques_only = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{table_name}{Character of table name, for informative messages.}

\item{NumStk}{Maximum number of stock, pulled from BaseID table}

\item{stock_vec}{vector of stock ids to check. Presumably column of fetched table.}

\item{uniques_only}{Do we want warnings if there are duplicats of StockIDs? Useful for tables like Stock and Growth that should have only one entry per stock. Logical, default = \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Numeric, returning number of warnings detected.
}
\description{
More thorough checking than stock_id_comp. Checks that the number of stock IDs makes sense given \code{NumStk},
that Stock IDs are sequential (in the sense that if NumStk = n, every integer up to n is represented).
Optionally, can check that each stock ID is unique.
