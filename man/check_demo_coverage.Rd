\title{Check if exported functions are documented in a file}
\usage{
check_demo_coverage(namespace_path, doc_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{namespace_path}{Character string. Path to the NAMESPACE file, typically
located at the root of an R package directory.}

\item{doc_path}{Character string. Path to the documentation file to check
(e.g., a .qmd, .Rmd, or .md file).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with three elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{found}}{Character vector of function names found in the document}
\item{\code{missing}}{Character vector of function names not found in the document}
\item{\code{coverage}}{Numeric percentage of functions documented}
}
}
\description{
Reads a package NAMESPACE file to extract exported functions and checks
whether each function appears in a specified documentation file (e.g., a
Quarto document or vignette). Reports coverage statistics to the console
using the cli package.
}
\details{
The function searches for function calls in the form \verb{function_name(} to
determine if a function is present in the documentation. It prints a
formatted report to the console showing which functions are documented
and which are missing.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Check if all exported functions appear in a vignette
check_demo_coverage("NAMESPACE", "vignettes/function_demo.qmd")

# Store results for further analysis
results <- check_demo_coverage("NAMESPACE", "README.md")
results$missing
}
