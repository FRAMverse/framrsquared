Summarizes the three true outcomes of a stocks abundance, where it
dies to fishery related mortality, natural mortality, or reaches
some sort of escapement. When run against the coho database
spawning escapement will be displayed, when run against the
Chinook database escapement to the river will be dislpayed
along with recruits to the next year 'age_up'}

\item{fram_db}{FRAM database object}

\item{run_id}{Run ID (optional)}
