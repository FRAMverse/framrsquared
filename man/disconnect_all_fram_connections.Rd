disconnect_all_fram_connections()

nothing

\description{
It is relatively easy to create an orphan connection using framrsquared by assigning a connection to \code{fram_db}, and then assigning another connection to \code{fram_db} without disconnecting the first connection using \code{disconnect_fram_db()}. Orphaned connections can make it frustrating to work with database files (moving, deleting, etc) without restarting rstudio or rebooting your computer. \code{disconnect_all_fram_connections()} disconnects any existing connections made by framrsquared in this R session.
