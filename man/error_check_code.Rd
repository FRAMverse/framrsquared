\usage{
error_check_code(filepath, n = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{filepath}{Path to R file to be checked}

\item{n}{Number of rows to print. Default is to print all rows, but set to smaller values if output is overwhelming.}
}
\description{
Tool to streamline development. Currently this checks for use of filter() without dplyr::. This would call
stats::filter(), which is usually not what I intend. As possible, add additional
checks for issues that cause problems but do not give an informative error message (or any error message).
