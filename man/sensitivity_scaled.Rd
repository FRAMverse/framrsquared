\usage{
sensitivity_scaled(
  fram_db,
  template_run,
  table_name,
  match_df,
  scale_values,
  cols_to_vary,
  tamm_template = NULL,
  tamm_target_folder = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fram_db}{Fram database}

\item{template_run}{Run ID of the run that should be used as a template for the sensitivity analyses.}

\item{table_name}{Name of FRAM table that will be modified for the sensitivity analyses}

\item{match_df}{dataframe that defines which rows should be modified during sensitivity analyses. To modify some values for marked and unmarked Stillaguamish stocks, we would use data.frame(match_StockID = c(17, 18)). To modify values only for Stillaguamish age 2s, we would use expand_grid(match_StockID = c(17, 19), match_Age = 2). Dev Note: Will update so that we can just use expand_grid(StockID = c(17, 19), Age = 2)}

\item{scale_values}{Numeric vector of the scaling factors to be be used, one per sensitivity analysis run. Defines the number of runs generated. For example, \code{scale_values = 2:10} would generate 9 runs. The first would multiply the values of interest by 2, the second by 3, etc.}

\item{cols_to_vary}{Character or character vector of column names of FRAM table \code{table_name} that should be rescaled.}

\item{tamm_template}{Optional; character string of filepath of a TAMM to be used as a template. If provided (and tamm_target_folder provided), \code{sensitivity_scaled} will make a tamm for each sensitivity analysis run, using names that work with the FRAM multirun fork "Use folder" option.}

\item{tamm_target_folder}{Folder to copy TAMMs into. Will create if it does not exist.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list of dataframes.
$scales_by_runs contains a row for each sensitivity run and maps the scaling factors to run ids.
$full_df is the full match/scale factor used by calc_fram_scaling, and shows the match conditions and scaling used for each run.
}
\description{
From a template FRAM run, for a single vector of scaling factors (e.g., \code{c(0.5, 2)} would test halving and doubling), generate sensitivity analyses which rescale the columns specied in (\code{cols_to_vary}) for rows which match the conditions specified in \code{match_df}. Optionally creates corresponding tamms from a template TAMM, labeled to work with folder loading option in the FRAM multi-run fork.
}
\details{
Dev note: update to allow match_df to NOT start with "match_" -- it's implied.
