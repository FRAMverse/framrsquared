\title{Create table comparing mortalities}
\usage{
create_mort_comparison(con.pre, con.post, year.focal, stock.focal)
}
\arguments{
\item{con.pre}{Connection to a Coho preseason database, presumably the complete one managed by the PSC. Must contain a run for the \code{year} year.}

\item{con.post}{Connection to a Coho postseason database, presumably the complete one managed by the PSC. Must contain a run for the \code{year} year.}

\item{year.focal}{Year to compare}

\item{stock.focal}{PSC stock to compare (\code{unique(framrosetta::stock_coho_psc$psc_stock_name)} to see all PSC stock)}
}
\value{
Dataframe of results:
\itemize{
\item \verb{$fishery_id}:  Fram fishery id
\item \verb{$preseason_mort_focal}:  Preseason estimated mortality of the focal stock (as defined with the \code{stock} parameter) in numbers of fish.
\item \code{postseason_mort_focal}:  Postseason mortality of the focal stock (as defined with the \code{stock} parameter) in numbers of fish.
\item \code{preseason_mort_other}:  Preseason estimated mortality of all stocks except the focal stock (as defined with the \code{stock} parameter) in numbers of fish.
\item \code{postseason_mort_other}:  Postseason mortality of all stocks except the focal stock (as defined with the \code{stock} parameter) in numbers of fish.
\item \code{overage}:  \code{postseason_mort_focal} - \code{preseason_mort_focal}. Positive values mean we believe we had higher mortality than we had estimated in the preseason.
\item \code{fishery_title}:  Name of the FRAM fishery
}
}
\description{
Tool for investigating causes of ER overages identified in PSC reports (e.g., the Annual Report). For a given stock in a given year (typically one that experienced an ER overage), compares the predicted mortalities in each fishery in the preseason with the estimated mortalities in those fisheries in the postseason. Also provides the context of the preseason and postseason estimated mortalities of other stocks; for mixed stock fisheries, mismatches between preseason and postseason abundances of other stock can lead to ER overages of a focal stock in FRAM even if modeling of the focal stock itself was perfect.
}
\details{
Intended as helper function for \code{present_mort_comparison()}, which provides a formatted \code{gt} table based on the output of this function. However, \code{create_mort_comparison()} will be useful for providing results in dataframes for further processing or plotting.
