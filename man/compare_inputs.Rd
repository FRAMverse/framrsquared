\title{Generates a dataframe that compares fishery scalers table for two runs identified by run_id's}
\usage{
compare_inputs(fram_db, run_ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{fram_db}{FRAM database object}

\item{run_ids}{Vector of two run_ids}
}
\value{
Data frame of differences. \verb{$percentdiff} = change in quota (comparing the appropriate quotas based on fishery flags),
\verb{$regulation_comparison}  = change in regulation (NS, MSF, NS + MSF). Columns present in the
FisheriesScalers database are included, with \verb{_original} and \verb{_comparison}
suffixes identifying entries associated with the first and second entries of
\code{run_ids}, respectively.
}
\description{
Generates a dataframe that compares fishery scalers table for two runs identified by run_id's
}
\details{
Comparisons assume the first run provided is the baseline, and provide relative changes from that.
This includes percent changes ($percent.diff)include percent changes (infinite when)
}
\examples{
\dontrun{fram_db |> compare_inputs(c(100,101))}
