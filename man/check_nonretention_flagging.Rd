\title{Check that non-retention entries match flags}
\usage{
check_nonretention_flagging(fram_db, run_id, wa_only = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fram_db}{FRAM database object}

\item{run_id}{FRAM run id}

\item{wa_only}{Check only Washington fisheries? Logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a modified version of NonRetention table, with new columns
\describe{
\item{\verb{$exist_ignored_vals}}{indicator for one or more non-zero values being ignored due to the flag}
\item{\verb{$exist_unexpected_zeroes}}{indicator for one or more zero values being used due to flag}
\item{\verb{$zeroes_exist_class}}{classification of entries with \verb{$exist_unexpected_zeroes = TRUE}}
}
}
\description{
Non-retention flags determine which values of the non-retention database are use. It is possible to accidentally forget to change flag or place values in the wrong locations.
}
\details{
This function checks for the following issues:
\itemize{
\item{Non-zero entries in cells that are IGNORED due to the flag. These seem like a big problem!}
\item{Zero entries in cells that are USED due to the flag. These may be correct, especially if the flag is 3 ("Legal/Sublegal Enc") as there might have been 0 sublegal or legal . Additionally, sometimes all entries are zero (e.g., presumably nonretention was intended to be zeroed out) but the flag was left as non-zero.}
